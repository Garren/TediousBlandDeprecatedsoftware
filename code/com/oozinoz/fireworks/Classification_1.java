/**
 * Objects of this class represent classifications of 
 * fireworks. In the United States, fireworks are 
 * classified as either "consumer" fireworks, or as 
 * "display" fireworks. Only consumer fireworks can be 
 * purchased and used without a license. States vary 
 * considerably in their decisions regarding which types of 
 * fireworks are "consumer" fireworks.
 * <p>
 * The name of this class ends with an underscore in order to 
 * distinguish it from a later version of the class that 
 * also appears in "The Design Patterns Java Workbook." 
 * Normally when you refactor code you should not include 
 * versioning information in class names. You should use a 
 * configuration management system to keep track of 
 * different versions. However, multiple versions of the 
 * "Classification" class appear simultaneously in the book 
 * and the naming scheme helps keep to differentiate 
 * these versions.
