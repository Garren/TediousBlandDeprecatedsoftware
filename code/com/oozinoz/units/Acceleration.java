/**
 * This class is a particular type of measure with the
 * dimension of acceleration. 
 *
 * You shouldn't normally use this class's constructor, 
 * preferring instead to use the units math built into this 
 * package. 
 * <p>
 * For example, a testing routine might create and check 
 * an acceleration as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Acceleration a =
 *         (Acceleration)
 *             FEET.times(32.17).divide(SECOND).divide(SECOND);
 *     assertEquals(G.dimension(), a.dimension());
 *     assertEquals(G.magnitude(), a.magnitude(), .01);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Note that G, the acceleration due to the Earth's gravity,
 * is one of many units that UnitConstants supplies.
