/**
 * A dimension object actually tracks the three dimensions of
 * typical physical quantities, namely length, mass, and time.
 *
 * A volume, for example, has a dimension of (3, 0, 0); it is
 * three-dimensional in length and has no mass or time.
 *
 * An acceleration has a dimension of (1, 0, -2), that is,
 * length per time per time.
 *
 * Dimensional arithmetic works with the exponents of 
 * dimensions. For example, length times length produces
 * a length dimension of 2.
