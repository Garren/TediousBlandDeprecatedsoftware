 * For example,
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Area a = (Area) INCH.times(INCH).times(.75);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * The INCH constant is a measure defined in UnitConstants.

	How this works.
	
	Let's say I have 1234.5678 and I want 2 significant digits 
	(that is, 1200.0). The strategy is to find the "right" 
	power of 10 to work with. In this example, the right number 
	is 100. To complete the rounding, divide by 100, round 
	using Math.round(), and multiply by 100. The trick is to 
	find the power of 10 to work with.
	
	The starting number, written in exponential notation is 
	1.2345678 * 10**3. We want log base 10 of this number to 
	get a grip on its size.
	
	There is no log base 10 function, but suppose
	
		y = log 10 (x)
	
	Then
	
		10 ** y = x
		Ln(10 ** y) = Ln(x) // Ln is a function I do have
		y * Ln(10) = Ln(x)
		y = Ln(x)/Ln(10) // this is a formula for y
		
	The "magnitude," for lack of a better term, is floor(y), in 
	the example case 3.
	
	I said I want 2 significant digits; in the example I would 
	divide by 100; in general the divisor is:
	
		10**(magnitude - (nDigit - 1))
		
	In this case the exponent is:
	
		3 - (2 - 1), or 2
	
	The code calculates 10**divisorExponent manually because Math.pow()
	was creating problems, specifically with negative exponents. For
	example, Math.pow(10, -1) is not exactly .1.	
		
	The rest of the algorithm is: divide by the divisor, round, 
	and multiply by the divisor.
